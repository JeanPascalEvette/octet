<h2>The Hinge</h2>
After some reasearch, I was able to find out about <a href="http://bullet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Demos/ConstraintDemo/ConstraintDemo.cpp"> this page</a> which contained a number of examples for bullet, and most importantly some example of Hinges and springs. I tried to use it to get it to work on my code, however, in order to create a hinge constraint, I had to use the rigid_bodies of my objects.
